      description: "There are a number of places to set up your scope within the park, offering different horizon conditions.  The comments above relate to what I feel is the best observing area, located near a large lake on the southeast section of the park (near some cabins).  Given the presence of overnight campers, you might have a chance of some non-astronomical neighbors, including the park rangers, stopping by during your earlier hours, car lights ablaze.  So if you engage in astrophotography, best to do it during the latter hours.  The park is patrolled, and very secure.",
