It takes a little over 2 hours to drive to the site from downtown Los Angeles. Since driving to Mt. Pinos takes almost 1 1/2 hours, the extra minutes are really worth it. There are no trees to block the horizons, and it is much warmer in the cooler months than Mt. Pinos. Some people might hesitate to visit a site so close to the deep desert, because of winds and the resulting dust, but I have never experienced windy conditions at this site, due to the peaks in between the desert and the site. Even if it is very windy in the desert, it will not be at the site. The elevation (5000 ft) gets the observer above a significant amount of the atmospheric dust and haze, but the temperature is never in the 'arctic' range.",

The West, North and overhead are impressive with exceptional sky quality on many nights. Users come from as far away as Houston to use this site.
